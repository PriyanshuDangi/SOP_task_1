# SOP_task_1
The task was to create a fun bubble burst game in which bubbles appear at random places on the screen. The main aim of the player is to burst the bubbles before they fill up a major part of the screen by tapping over the bubbles.

### Sub Tasks
All the ticked sub tasks or given sub tasks are completed.
- [x] **Basic Task**
    - [x] Design an intro page to the game using pure HTML and CSS
    - [x] The bubbles must move randomly and bounce in the opposite direction when they hit the sides of the screen or any other bubble. They must disappear immediately when the player clicks anywhere on the bubble.
    - [x] As time progresses, the speed of bubble generation must increase.
    - [x] If more than 75% of the screen gets covered with bubbles for 10 seconds, the game ends. You
can show a timer on-screen to make it thrilling!
    - [x] Get creative on how you define a scoring system!
    - [x] Give options to pause and resume the game.
    - [x] Optimise the code, to make the animations and movement of bubbles look smooth.
- [x] **Advanced Task**
    - [x] Get more creative by making the bubbles change colours and sizes dynamically with animations for bubble bursting.
    - [x] After Player crosses a particular score, start creating rock-bubbles which require five clicks to get destroyed. Use your creativity to differentiate rock bubbles from ordinary ones.
    - [x] Allow the player to use “Felix-Felicis” (Liquid Luck) which slows down the rate of generation of bubbles for 5 secs. (Could be used only twice throughout the gameplay) and the rate of bubble generation is left to your choice.
    - [x] Place Gauntlets rarely on-screen on clicking which you make a snap and clear half of the screen at once (even if there are rock-bubbles). The occurrence of Gauntlet can increase with time.
    - [x] Use sprite sheets for the Rock-Bubble and Gauntlet to make them look more real.
    - [x] Add background music and sound effects to make the game more engaging. Include the high score feature using local storage.
